# Meditation App

Build a single-page meditation app that leverages the Web Storage API to persist user preferences across sessions.

## User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to...

* Select between various nature settings: beach, forest, rain, stream
* For each setting, see a relevant background image
* For each setting, see relevant text and div colors
* For each setting, hear appropriate ambient sounds and/or music
* If I leave the page and come back, it loads whichever setting I last had selected

## Tips:

* Find Creative Commons photos by searching Google with “Creative commons” license selected. (See screenshot for example). Wikimedia Commons often has particularly good hi-res images.

* Search for Creative Commons music or sounds: https://creativecommons.org/about/program-areas/arts-culture/arts-culture-resources/legalmusicforvideos/ 

* Find Ambient Sounds: https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Ambience
